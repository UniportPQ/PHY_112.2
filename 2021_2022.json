      "type": "string",
      "content": "Inside a conductor in electrostatic equilibrium, the electric field is zero because free charges within the conductor redistribute themselves to cancel any internal field. This implies that the net charge inside the conductor must be zero; any excess charge resides on the surface. Therefore, the correct answer is zero. The option one is incorrect as it doesn’t specify a physical quantity (like one unit of charge) and doesn’t fit the context. None of the above and all of the above are incorrect because zero is the specific condition that applies here."

      "content": "The unit of magnetic field strength, Tesla (T), is defined as the magnetic flux density. By definition, 1 Tesla equals 1 Weber per square meter (\\( 1 \\text{T} = 1 \\frac{\\text{Wb}}{\\text{m}^2} \\)). This makes 1Wb/m² the correct answer. 1Wb/m²m is dimensionally incorrect (it simplifies to Wb/m³, which isn’t a unit of magnetic field). 1N/(A.m) is a derived unit for magnetic field (from the force on a current-carrying wire, \\( F = I L B \\)), but it’s equivalent to 1 T, not the primary definition. 1Wb/m is a unit of magnetic flux per length, not magnetic field. Thus, 1Wb/m² is the correct definition of 1 Tesla."

A dielectric is a material that increases the capacitance by reducing the electric field between the plates through polarization. While a dielectric is often an insulator (a material that doesn’t conduct electricity), the specific term for its role in a capacitor is dielectric. Polarizer is incorrect as it relates to optics (polarizing light), not capacitors. Ion refers to a charged particle, not a medium in this context. Therefore, dielectric is the precise term."

      "content": "The potential difference across the battery terminals (terminal voltage) is \\( V = \\text{EMF} - I r \\), where \\( I \\) is the current and \\( r \\) is the internal resistance. First, calculate the current using the total resistance: \\( R_{\\text{total}} = R_{\\text{external}} + r = 16 + 2 = 18 \\Omega \\). Current \\( I = \\frac{\\text{EMF}}{R_{\\text{total}}} = \\frac{12}{18} = \\frac{2}{3} \\text{A} \\). The voltage drop across the internal resistance is \\( I r = \\frac{2}{3} \\times 2 = \\frac{4}{3} \\text{V} \\). So, the terminal voltage is \\( V = 12 - \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{36}{3} - \\frac{4}{3} = \\frac{32}{3} \\approx 10.667 \\text{V} \\). This makes 10.667V the correct answer. 21.33V and 24V are too high (exceeding the EMF), and 0.75V is too low (misinterpreting the circuit)."

This makes ILB sin θ the correct answer, as it directly matches the standard formula. vLB sin θ is incorrect because \\( v \\) (velocity) applies to a moving charge, not a wire with current. IL is the force when \\( \theta = 90^\\circ \\), but the question specifies a general angle \\( \theta \\). Bθ is dimensionally incorrect and not a force formula.

EMF is the maximum voltage a source can provide, measured when no current flows, so no energy is lost to internal resistance. Net voltage and battery voltage are not standard terms in this context.

      "type": "string",
      "content": "In AC circuits, the stated voltage (e.g., 120V) is typically the root mean square (RMS) voltage. An AC voltmeter measures the RMS voltage, but the question’s phrasing suggests a possible misunderstanding. The peak voltage \\( V_{\\text{peak}} \\) is related to the RMS voltage by \\( V_{\\text{RMS}} = \\frac{V_{\\text{peak}}}{\\sqrt{2}} \\). For an RMS voltage of 120V, the peak voltage is \\( V_{\\text{peak}} = 120 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 170 \\text{V} \\). However, the options 170A and 85A are incorrect units (current, not voltage). Between 120V and 85V, 85V might reflect a common RMS value in some regions (e.g., 120V RMS corresponds to a peak of 170V, but 85V RMS corresponds to a peak of \\( 85 \\times \\sqrt{2} \\approx 120 \\text{V} \\)), suggesting the question may imply a different standard. Given typical AC voltmeter readings, 85V is the closest plausible RMS value in the options, though 120V would be expected for a direct reading."
